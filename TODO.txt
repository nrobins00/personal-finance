TODO:
-figure out why 1 of the updates didn't work.
    - might just be because I didn't give access to all the same accounts
        -start by debugging to figure out which plaid error type it is

transition to server-side rendering:
- handle plaid/link user (save to DB or something)
- move authentication into middleware

- refactor get/save account code
- create component(s) for displaying accounts + balances
- create component(s) for budget display
- redo getting transactions
- adding filter option to transaction list
- better auth / secure storage of access key 
- sessions (https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gorilla/sessions#section-readme)
- webhooks for auto updating transaction history?

completed: 
- update personal finance categories to use detailed as PK
