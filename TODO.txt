TODO:

[ ] webhooks for auto updating transaction history
    [ ] never call getTransactions directly from user. webhook will fire when update is needed

[ ] auth:
    [ ] move authentication into middleware
    [ ] better auth / secure storage of access key 

- redo getting transactions
- adding filter option to transaction list
- sessions (https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gorilla/sessions#section-readme)
- prevent duplicate items (https://plaid.com/docs/link/duplicate-items)
- filter by primary categories?
