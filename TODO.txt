TODO:
[ ] implement budgets
    [ ] sub-budgets for broad categories
    [ ] fancy front-end entry form to handle optional "advanced"
    [ ] somewhere (probably home screen) compare spending to budget for categories

[x] webhooks for auto updating transaction history
    [x] never call getTransactions directly from user. webhook will fire when update is needed
    [x] ngrok for port forwarding to listen to webhooks

[ ] database updates
    [ ] maybe can use some kind of special handling that sets a transaction's accountKey only if the account exists
[ ] webhooks for account updates
    [ ] use Link's update mode to request access from user
[ ] prevent duplicate items (https://plaid.com/docs/link/duplicate-items)
[ ] consider using go templates to build sql queries

[ ] auth:
    [ ] handle token expiration
    [ ] move authentication into middleware
    [ ] better auth / secure storage of access key 

- sessions (https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gorilla/sessions#section-readme)
- filter by primary categories?
